## 1. Problem Statement Name  

AI-Powered EdTech Platform with Interactive 3D AI Professor  

---

## 2. Problem Statement Description  

Online education platforms are rapidly expanding, yet most fail to deliver **deeply engaging, personalized, and skill-oriented experiences**, especially in technically demanding domains.  

The challenge lies in moving beyond **passive video lectures and generic assessments** to create an environment where students actively **build, apply, and master complex skills**.  

This project aims to tackle one of the hardest problems in EdTech: designing an **AI-powered platform that leverages an interactive 3D AI professor** to deliver **personalized, immersive courses**.  

Students must be able to **generate custom courses** using advanced search tags (e.g., `#web-development`, `#machine-learning`, `#cloud-native`, `#react.js`, `#data-structures`).  

The 3D AI professor should deliver **interactive lessons**, respond to nuanced technical queries in real time, and guide learners through **rigorous, project-based assessments** simulating real-world challenges.

## 3. Project Overview  

Focus Plus is an AI-enhanced **Smart Dashboard** that merges productivity with immersive education. It provides:  

- **Session Notes** with auto-save and export  
- **Task Scheduler** with deadlines  
- **AI Bot Professor** for interactive learning (Q&A, file-based content)  
- **Customizable Focus Timer** with MediaPipe attention tracking  
- **Reports & Analytics** for session insights  
- **Theme Customization** for personalization  

On the EdTech side, it extends into a **3D Interactive AI Professor** delivering courses, guiding projects, and resolving complex doubts in real time.
